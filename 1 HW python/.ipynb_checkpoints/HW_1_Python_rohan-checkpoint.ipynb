    "1. If you don't have one already, put a text editor on your computer. There are many to choose from: [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and so on. There are many times when using a Jupyter notebook, as amazing as they are, won't work. If you haven't used any of these editors, I recommend getting a few so that you can compare them. The choice is often very personal, which is why I am giving you the opportunity to explore and choose the best one for you.\n",
    "2. Be sure that you can work at the command line. How this works differs greatly from computer to computer. For example, on a Mac you always use the [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS)). As with the editors, there are many choices, [like this](https://iterm2.com/).  If you are a windows user, you definitely want to [read this](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/a-beginners-guide-to-the-windows-command-line/). Together, the editor and the command line will allow you to execute `.py` files, which can be really useful if you are using another computer (such as a cluster located somewhere else, such as MSU's HPCC facility).\n",
    "3. Once those two steps are done, open the editor you chose and put this code in it, giving it any name you want, but ending with `.py`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import streamlit as st\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",

    "Note that you will likely have to install some libraries on your computer.\n",
    "4. At the command line, run your file using `streamlit run name.py`, where `name` is whatever name you chose for your file in your editor. An interactive web app should appear in your browser. Don't worry about the details at this point, which we will cover later in the course: the goal for this HW is just to **get your computer setup properly** for deployable interactive DS apps.\n",
    "5. In a markdown cell, put the answers to these questions:\n",
    "* which editor(s) did you choose, and why?\n",
    "* what did you decide to use for your command line? (e.g., are you on OSX and using the built-in `Terminal`?)\n",
    "* did you have any problems installing the libraries, such as `streamlit` and `altair`?\n",
