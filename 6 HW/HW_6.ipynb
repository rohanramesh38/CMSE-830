    "* After each presentation, the rest of the group will have $\\sim 5$ minutes to discuss the project and ask their questions.\n",

    "* you developed a story/narrative of the dataset,\n",

To do that, you need to create a GH repository (create a public repo for your project to ensure that the streamlit link you shared can be opened by anyone in your group, me or Mahyar). Once you have a repo with a python file, required data files, and a `requirement.txt`, you need to login to streamlit (with the same email as you have for GH account). There you can create a new app based on the project repository. If you have any problems, post your questions in Slack.\n",

    "When you are done, paste the link here so that Mahyar can test it. Mahyar will share a google document on **Oct. 16** which you are going to put your **full name** and the **streamlit link** for your webapp (remember that link for your final version of mid-term project should be provided before the class starts on **Oct. 18**).\n",

    "* give a $\\sim 10$ minute presentation during class (on the Wed **Oct. 18**),\n",
    "* turn in your code and dataset to D2L,\n",
    "* provide the link to the operational web app.\n",
