Below the EDA code cells for each dataset, open a markdown cell and write a paragraph that answers these questions:\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, open a new markdown and discuss which of these three datasets would make the best project dataset. Were some of the datasets disappointing? Was one of the datasets much richer with possibilities?
