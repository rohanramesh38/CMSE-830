Since regression only knows there is an input $X$ and an output $y$, it does \"care\" that the data came from a time series; and, what a great way to predict the weather tomorrow - use the weather for the past few days! This is our first idea: we get started by using the data at the very end of the dataset and start by predicting the first future time point.\n",

For this, we need the second important idea: once we make a prediction, we add that to our previous dataset and then forecast again using this new dataset. Said another way: we use $N$ (final) points to predict the future value $y$, which is appended to the end of the dataset for use in the next prediction. We then predict this over and over and over until we are done. When you do this many times, it is called \"multi-step ahead\".\n",
