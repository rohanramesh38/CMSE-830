Because data on the incidence and prevalence of diseases are frequently unavailable, mortality rates are often used to identify vulnerable populations. And they are among the indicators most frequently used to compare socioeconomic development across countries.""",Data from United Nations Population Division's World Populaton Prospects are originally 5-year period data and the presented are linearly interpolated by the World Bank for annual series. Therefore they may not reflect real events as much as observed data.,,"""The main sources of mortality data are vital registration systems and direct or indirect estimates based on sample surveys or censuses. A ""complete"" vital registration system - covering at least 90 percent of vital events in the population - is the best source of age-specific mortality data. Where reliable age-specific mortality data are available, life tables can be constructed from age-specific mortality data, and adult mortality rates can be calculated from life tables.""",,,,,,,
