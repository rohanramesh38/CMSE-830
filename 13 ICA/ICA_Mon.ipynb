    "The idea behind MNIST is to use ML to learn how to recognize handwritten numbers: the digits between $0$ and $9$. This is an interesting dataset because the data comes to us in the form of images, not just some numbers. While there are some pretty specific ways to handle images in ML, we'll use the simplest approach here. What we do is \"unravel\" the image into a string of features: each individual pixel of the image is a feature. Because the image has a lot of pixels, we end up with many features -- $64$ in this case. Iris and penguins only had $4$ features. To see this, let's put the image back to together and visualize the data. In `sklearn`, the images are square $8\\times 8$, so we can `reshape` them and make an image. \n",

As we will see, this adds almost no complexity to your code, other than copying, pasting and changing a few words in each line. Importantly, you don't know in advance which estimator will work best on your data, so you should always **try all estimators**. Over time, you might build your intuition, or have some other reason for a particular choice, but for now use all/many of the classifiers. (Same is true for regression, clustering, etc.) \n",

    "I should mention a counter example that really illustrates the point: I wouldn't always use all of the `sklearn` algorithms for dimensionality reduction. Why? Because the algorithms do very different things: I would research the algorithms and pick the one that does what my problem really needs. The point is that if the estimators are all equivalent, you really have no reason to not use all of them; if you know they have a specialized function, then take that into account. \n",

[Go to this website](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.html) and look at the figure. Look at the leftmost columns - there are three datasets (the rows) for classification in 2D.

    "* the bottom one is perhaps easiest: blue on the left, red on the right; do they all get this right? \n",
    "* the top dataset makes this a bit harder by having the two classes fold into each in a way that doesn't follow a line - it's like two moons,\n",

    "In case you don't spot it right away: there are tiny scores given in the lower right of each image. Also, pay attention to whether the data points are solid or semi-tranparent: that's training versus testing - this gives you a sense for what the test-train split does for you. Include these insights in your discussion in the markdown cell. (You might want to increase the size of the plot on your screen!) \n",
